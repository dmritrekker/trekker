Trekker offers state-of-the-art tractography tools to study the structural connectivity of the brain. Trekker aims to improve fiber tracking pipelines by offering features like:

- **Well-organized, clean, probabilistic streamline tractography** using the parallel transport tractography (PTT) algorithm.
- A comprehensive set of **tractogram filtering** options, including support for anatomical constraints using surface meshes.
- Compatibility with **.vtk** format, to enable the use of powerful third-party 3D rendering software, such as [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/), for easy and high-quality visualizations.
- **Support for asymmetric FODs**, providing greater flexibility in fiber tracking.
- Several features designed for high-performance computing (HPC), including **multithreading**, **time-limited tracking**, and a user-friendly **command line interface**.

üèÜ **Awards and Recognitions:**

Tractography pipelines based on Trekker have earned awards in every international tractography challenge since 2017. Click [here](https://dmritrekker.github.io/about/awards.html) to read more about Trekker's awards.

## Installation

**Stand-alone executables:** Please find the stand-alone executables under [Releases](https://github.com/dmritrekker/trekker/releases).


### Building from Source

#### Step 1: Download the Source Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmritrekker/trekker
```

#### Step 2: Modify and run the build script

```bash
sh build.sh
```


### Examples

**Fiber tracking example:**
```bash
./trekker track \
          FOD.nii.gz \
          --seed WHITE_MATTER_SURFACE.gii \
          --seed_surf_useSurfNorm \
          --seed_count 100000 \
          --pathway discard_if_ends_inside WHITE_MATTER.nii.gz \
          --pathway discard_if_enters CSF.nii.gz \
          --minLength 20 \
          --maxLength 300 \
          --output OUT_TRACK.vtk
```

**Fiber filtering example:**
```bash
# You can use the --seed option when filtering too.
./trekker filter \
          INP_TRACK.vtk \
          --seed WHITE_MATTER_SURFACE.gii \
          --pathway require_end_inside LEFT_THAL.nii.gz \
          OUT_TRACK.vtk
```
