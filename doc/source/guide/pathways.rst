Pathways
========

Definitions
-----------

Trekker allows for a variety of pathway rules to apply anatomical constraints for fiber tracking and filtering. Before reading the rules in detail, please check the illustration below for definitions:

	:alt: Trekker's pathways

	When a seed is provided, Trekker regards each streamline to be composed of two sides, which are called **A** and **B**.

.. tip::

   - Trekker automatically determines the sides as **A** or **B** based on how they meet the user defined pathway rules, i.e., if the first side meets the criteria for **B** then Trekker assigns it as side **B**.
   - When a **seed** is not provided, rules with **_A** or **_B** options can not be used.
   - You can disable the default \"two-sided\" *tracking* or *filtering* by using the ``--oneSided`` option.




Rules
-----

Trekker offers powerful options for specifying pathway definitions. Rules can be defined using the ``--pathway`` option followed by one of the below rules:


- Require rules
   - **require_entry**: Pathway has to enter the region
   - **require_exit**: Pathway has to enter and then exit the region
   - **require_end_inside**: Pathway has to enter but can't exit the region

- Discard rules
   - **discard_if_enters**: Pathway can't enter the region
   - **discard_if_exits**:  Pathway can enter but can't exit the region
   - **discard_if_ends_inside**: Pathway can enter but can't end inside the region

- Stop rules (requires a *seed* to be defined first)
   - **stop_at_entry**: If a pathway enters the region, it will be truncated at the point of entry. The end point will be *precisely* the region border.
   - **stop_before_entry**: If a pathway is about to enter the region, it will be truncated just before it enters there. The end point will be outside the region.
   - **stop_after_entry**: If a pathway enters the region, it will be truncated just after it enters there. The end point will be inside the region.
   - **stop_at_exit**:  If a pathway exits the region, it will be truncated at the point of exit. The end point will be *precisely* the region border.
   - **stop_before_exit**: If a pathway is about to exit the region, it will be truncated just before it exit. The end point will still be inside the region.
   - **stop_after_exit**: If a pathway exits the region, it will be truncated just after it exits. The end point will be outside the region.

   **Why stop before / at / after?**

   - Trekker supports surface meshes for tracking and filtering.
   - A surface has a 2D boundary, which requires further considerations for tractography.

   **Example:**

   - Using the **stop_at_entry** rule, a whole-brain tractogram is obtained so that streamlines are truncated *exactly* at the white-matter gray-matter interface, defined with a surface mesh.

   **Question:** What happens when the user later wants to extract a specific fiber bundle using a portion of the same surface?

   **Answer:** In that case, some streamlines will follow the defined rule, but others will not. This occurs because the initial truncation places the end-point on the border with precision defined by float32 computations. Therefore, during a subsequent check, it is not guaranteed that the point will be recognized as being precisely on the surface. Providing the *before* and *after* options allows the user more flexibility for setting their rules.

**The rules can be further fine-tuned using the following options:**

- With ``--inOrder`` option is used, `require_entry` and `require_exit` rules are adhered to in the order that they are specified.

- Trekker supports the definition of seed regions for both *tracking* and *filtering*, using the ``--seed`` or ``-s`` options.

- When a seed is defined for *filtering*, all the streamlines are treated as if they were computed using that region as the seed. This means that if only a seed is provided without any other filtering option, the result is identical to the case where only the `require_entry` rule is defined.

- The following filtering features can only be used when a seed is defined:

   - **Side-specific filtering:** The above pathway rules can be defined separately for each side of the track, using `_A` and `_B` extensions, e.g., `require_entry_A` or `discard_if_ends_inside_B`. Here, the seed is considered to be somewhere between the end points A and B. If one of the pathway rules is defined using the `_A` or `_B` extensions, then all the other rules must also have an `_A` or `_B` extension.

   - **One-sided filtering:** The ``--oneSided`` option can only be used when pathway rules are not side-specific. When ``--oneSided`` is used, starting from the seed, only one side of the track is taken into account, the other side is ignored, and it will not appear in the output.

   - **Skipping seed:** The ``--skipSeed`` option can only be used together with ``--oneSided``. When ``--skipSeed`` is enabled, the output tracks only have one point that falls within the seed, and that point is one of the endpoints of the tracks.

   - **Using stop rules:** The `stop_at_entry` and `stop_at_exit` rules can only be used when a seed is defined.




Regions
-------

Trekker supports the following to be used together with the *seed* and *pathway rule* definitions:

- **Sphere:**
  e.g. ``-p require_entry 1.2,2.4,33.2,4`` defines a sphere using x,y,z,r notation.

- **Image files (.nii, .nii.gz):** The use of images are interpreted in six different ways:

  1. If only an integer type image is provided, as in ``img.nii``, then it is considered as a mask that is created by thresholding values above zero. During filtering, nearest neighbor interpolation is used.
  2. If only a floating type image is provided, as in ``img.nii``, then it is considered to provide partial volume fraction. A value above zero is considered inside, and during filtering, linear interpolation is used.
  3. If an image is provided followed by ``label``, as in ``img.nii label``, then it is considered as a mask that is created by thresholding values above zero. During filtering, nearest neighbor interpolation is used.
  4. If an image is provided followed by ``pvf``, as in ``img.nii pvf``, then it is considered to provide partial volume fraction. A value above zero is considered inside, and during filtering, linear interpolation is used.
  5. If an image is provided followed by ``label`` and an integer, as in ``img.nii label 1023``, then the provided integer value is considered as a label and a label image is created only using that value. During filtering, nearest neighbor interpolation is used.
  6. If an image is provided followed by ``pvf`` and an integer, as in ``img.nii pvf 0``, then it is considered that the input image is 4-dimensional, where the 4th dimension contains partial volume fractions, and the provided integer indicates the volume to use for filtering. A value above zero is considered inside, and during filtering, linear interpolation is used.

- **Surface files (.vtk, .gii):**

  1. Surfaces can be provided only as they are, as in ``-s surf.vtk``.
  2. If the surface is followed by x,y,z,r notation, as in ``-s surf.vtk 1.2,2.4,33.2,4``, then a disc centered at x,y,z with radius r is extracted and used for the rule.
  3. If the surface is followed by a string and an integer, as in ``-s surf.vtk label,3``, then the surface is considered to contain a field with the provided string. The integer is used as a label, which is used for filtering, e.g., a surface containing labels for different parts of the brain can be used for filtering.
  4. If the surface is defined as in ``-s surf.vtk fileName,VERT,int,3``, then the fileName is considered to contain labels for each VERTices, the file contains ``int`` (integer) data type, and the filtering should only consider VERTices with label 3.

  .. note::
     - Inside/outside of a surface is determined by the direction of the normal vectors. It is considered that normals point towards the outside of surface meshes. This convention can be changed by using ``-s surf.vtk flipNormals``, which will internally flip the direction of the surface normals when tracking/filtering.
     - For fast filtering, Trekker first discretizes the surface meshes onto images. The default discretization resolution is 1, which can be changed by proving a scalar number after the surface file is defined, as in ``-s surf.vtk 0.4 label,3``, where 0.4 will be used to discretize the surface.
     - If the surface is closed, it is possible exclude the interior region, and only apply the rules based on the surface mesh (boundary). This can be done by adding ``2D`` after the file name, as in ``-s surf.vtk 2D label,3``.
     - It is possible change the place of the surface options, e.g. ``-s surf.vtk label,3 0.5 2D`` is same as ``-s surf.vtk 0.5 label,3 2D``.
