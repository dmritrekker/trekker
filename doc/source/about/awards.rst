Young scientist award
---------------------

Prior to Parallel Transport Tractography (PTT) [Aydogan2019]_, [Aydogan2021]_, Trekker was implementing an earlier version of the algorithm that was based on the Frenet-Serret frame [Aydogan2016]_. This work was ranked among the top five papers at MICCAI 2016, leading to a **Young Scientist Award**.
