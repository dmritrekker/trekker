        "\n  \033[1m \u2022 stop_after_entry:\033[0m tracks will stop immediately after they enter the region. The end point is inside the region. (requires \033[1mseed\033[0m to be defined)"
        "\n  \033[1m \u2022 stop_before_entry:\033[0m tracks will stop just before they enter the region. The end point is outside the region. (requires \033[1mseed\033[0m to be defined)"

Here, seed is considered to be somewhere between the end points A and B.

        "\n       \033[1m 3.\033[0m If an image is provided followed by \'label\', as in \'-s img.nii label\', then it is considered as a mask that is created by thresholding values above zero. And during filtering, nearest neighbor interpolation is used."

        "\n       \033[1m 6.\033[0m If an image is provided followed by \'pvf\' and an integer, as in \'-s img.nii label 0\', then it is considered that the input image is 4 dimensional, where the 4th dimension contains partial volume fractions, and the provided integer indicates the volume to use for filtering.

        "\n       \033[1m Note 1:\033[0m Inside/outside of a surface is determined by the direction of the normal vectors. It is considered that normals point towards the outside of surface meshes. This convention can be changed by using ``-s surf.vtk flipNormals``, which will internally flip the direction of the surface normals when tracking/filtering."
        "\n       \033[1m Note 2:\033[0m For fast filtering, Trekker first discretizes the surface meshes onto images. The default discretization resolution is 1, which can be changed by proving a scalar number after the surface file is defined, as in \'-s surf.vtk 0.4 label,3\', where 0.4 will be used to discretize the surface."
        "\n       \033[1m Note 3:\033[0m If the surface is closed, it is possible exclude the interior region, and only apply the rules based on the surface mesh (boundary). This can be done by adding \'2D\' after the file name, as in \'-s surf.vtk 2D label,3\'"
